Login Functionality:

● User Registration and Authentication:
○ Implement a user registration system with fields for username, email,
and password.
○ Upon registration, send a confirmation email with a verification link.
Users should only be able to log in after email verification (Just an
explanation on how this can be achieved, no need to code).

● Profile Page:
○ Create a user dashboard where registered users can:
■ View and edit their profiles (username, email).
■ View all the profiles registered.

● Password Reset:
○ Allow users to request a password reset via email. Generate a secure
token for resetting the password (Just an explanation no need to
code).
